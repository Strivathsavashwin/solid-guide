# Vein Viewer

The txt file has the code developed for viewing the superficial veins of our human body with the help of a low cost prototype which has a Infra Red LED system. Veins absorb more infra red rays at 700 nm wavelength due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the veins. Made use of contast enhancement algorithm like CLAHE(Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) and additionaly used a set of noise reducing filteres. Implemeted in Python using OpenCV library.
